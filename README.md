# 40k_points_regression

The plan this time is to attempt to see if we can predict the points value of a model in the popular miniatures game warhammer 40,000 based on its stat line and special rules. If we straight up can't, maybe the game is poorly balanced garbage who knows? and if thats the case then my loosing isnt actually a reflection of any meaningful skills whatsoever but rather a preordained farce. wouldnt that be a shame...

data sources used:

some guy whosting a somewhat dubious website online that I wont link...

The intention from this project is to get back to doing some modelling as I've been removed from that world for a while now and miss dicking around with parameters.
