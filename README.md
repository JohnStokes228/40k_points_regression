# 40k_points_regression

The plan this time is to attempt to see if we can predict the points value of a model in the popular miniatures game warhammer 40,000 based on its stat line and special rules. If we straight up can't, maybe the game is poorly balanced garbage who knows?

data sources used:

some guy whosting a somewhat dubious website online that I wont link...

hopefully this will allow us to do some regression analysis and modelling (lol).
